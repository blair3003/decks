# Decks

**Decks is a micro-project that further explores the combined use of Figma and Astro to design and implement a web application, based on a concept for a deck building social media network.**

I took a mobile-first approach to the design of this application, and started with an iPhone 14 frame. I also wanted to design for dark mode, and since I planned to use Tailwind, I grabbed the RGB codes for the grays in TW as well as an accent teal. The icons were downloaded from Flaticon and masked with the teal.
